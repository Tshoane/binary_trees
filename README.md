"Binary_trees" is a project dedicated to exploring binary tree data structures across various programming languages. These hierarchical structures consist of nodes, each with up to two children, and find applications in computer science and algorithm design. The project involves implementing classes and functions for common tree operations, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
